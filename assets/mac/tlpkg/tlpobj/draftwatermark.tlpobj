shortdesc Put a grey textual watermark on document pages
longdesc The package provides a means to add a watermark (typically a
longdesc light gray piece of text) on every page or on the first page of
longdesc a document. Typical usage may consist in writing words such as
longdesc DRAFT or CONFIDENTIAL across document pages. The package
longdesc performs a similar function to that of draftcopy, but its
longdesc implementation is output device independent. As of December
longdesc 2020, the package relies on the new shipout hooks directly
longdesc provided by LaTeX. For users of older versions of LaTeX, the
longdesc package also provides a legacy version of itself (that is
longdesc automatically loaded, currently being at release 2.3) which
longdesc relies on the everypage package. Note that this legacy version
longdesc will progressively lag behind in terms of features.
