shortdesc Selectively include/exclude portions of text
longdesc Selectively include/exclude pieces of text, allowing the user
longdesc to define new, separately controlled, comment versions. All
longdesc text between \comment ... \endcomment or \begin{comment} ...
longdesc \end{comment} is discarded. The opening and closing commands
longdesc should appear on a line of their own. No starting spaces,
longdesc nothing after it. This environment should work with arbitrary
longdesc amounts of comment, and the comment can be arbitrary text.
longdesc Other 'comment' environments are defined and
longdesc selected/deselected with \includecomment{versiona} and
longdesc \excludecomment{versionb} These environments are used as
longdesc \versiona ... \endversiona or \begin{versiona} ...
longdesc \end{versiona} with the opening and closing commands again on a
longdesc line of their own.
