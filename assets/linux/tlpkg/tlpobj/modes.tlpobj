shortdesc A collection of Metafont mode_def's
longdesc The modes file collects all known Metafont modes for printing
longdesc or display devices, of whatever printing technology. Special
longdesc provision is made for write-white printers, and a 'landscape'
longdesc mode is available, for making suitable fonts for printers with
longdesc pixels whose aspect is non-square. The file also provides
longdesc definitions that make \specials identifying the mode in
longdesc Metafont's GF output, and put coding information and other
longdesc Xerox-world information in the TFM file.
