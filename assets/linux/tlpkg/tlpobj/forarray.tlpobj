shortdesc Using array structures in LaTeX
longdesc The package provides functionality for processing lists and
longdesc array structures in LaTeX. Arrays can contain characters as
longdesc well as TeX and LaTeX commands, nesting of arrays is possible,
longdesc and arrays are processed within the same brace level as their
longdesc surrounding environment. Array levels can be delimited by
longdesc characters or control sequences defined by the user. Practical
longdesc uses of this package include data management, construction of
longdesc lists and tables, and calculations based on the contents of
longdesc lists and arrays.
